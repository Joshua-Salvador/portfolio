          I have been teaching myself, of course with some reading and online courses, Web Development the past few years, but only this year did I have the chance to dedicate time to learning even deeper. 
          I am presently trying my best to learn the MERN stack.

          To those who are viewing this site, I sincerely hope you consider my application as your Front-End React Developer. I cannot make any promises, as I may not resolve them. But this I can declare, that
          whatever function I play in the team, I will definetely return something. I am still young and learning, but I am constantly pushing items into my Array of Knowledge and Skills.
